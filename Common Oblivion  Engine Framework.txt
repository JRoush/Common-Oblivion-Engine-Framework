The Common Oblivion Engine Framework (COEF? there are so many mods known only by acronyms already ...) is basically a 
customized version of the 'common' project shipped with obse.  Key feature is that it provides an API to directly link
to game code through a 'virtual' dll interface.

The 'COEF' API must be in the global namespace to get the correct RTTI names for the classes.  Many of the classes are 
already partially implemented by obse in the global namespace, so in general one *cannot* have OBSE 'game api' headers
and COEF 'api' headers in the same compilation unit.

Ideally, the COEF Utility code should eliminate the need for OBSE\GameAPI and OBSE\Common dependence.  In practice, this
will require some questionable typedefs and mecros to 'wrap' the new code with the existing names and conventions.

The COEF API must be manually patched into Oblivion.exe (TESConstructionSet.exe) by ExportInjector.  Due to the apparent
behavior of LoadLibrary, ExportInjector must be fully loaded before COEF-based dlls can be loaded.  If obse can be 
convinced to load it first, then no sweat.  If not, the plguin must take a 3-project approach: 1 loader to handle the obse
interface, load ExportInjector if it's not already present, and load the two child dlls (game/CS).

    -   API (Source):
        Exposes Oblivion/TESCS classes to the plugin
        -   header files and .eed files for compile-time linkage
        -   ExportInjector & custom prebuild step to parse eed -> def -> lib
        -   subdlls linked to libs for appropriate module
        -   every header must include MemoryHeap.h to ensure override of global new/delete
    -   API (Runtime):
        Exposes Oblivion/TESCS classes to the plugin
        -   .eed files, Export Injector + ini file(s)
        -   LoadLibrary(ExportInjector) from Loader dll
    -   Standard Environment:
        IDE configuration state
        -   Macros: MFC, OBLIVION, OBLIVION_VERSION, CS_VERSION

        -   (optional) copy output to oblivion install folder
     -  Standard 'Prefix':
        Force include in all compilation units
        -   Win32 version defines & Windows.h/AFX/MFC
        -   C standard library headers - cstdlib, cstdio, cstring, winsock2(? compatibility with obse)
        -   Disable warnings  
        -   API Macros: IMPORT, LOCAL, NOUSE, etc.
        -   Includes for 'common' utilities or their replacements (compatibility with obse)
    -   Standard Utilities:
        Common tasks with complex/difficult implementations
        -   Patching game memory
        -   Making function calls/jumps to memory
        -   Patching/Copying vtbls
        -   Patching/Copying RTTI data
        -   Output logging (include wrappers for compatibility with obse logging)
        -   Singleton (? compatibility with obse)
        -   DynamicCreate (? compatibility with obse)    
        -   Error (? compatibility with obse) 

        
-   OBSE Plugin API:
====================
Set of header files, and perhaps some compilations units (not ideal) to interface with obse
    -   PluginAPI.h, CommandTable.h
    -   Implementation for small helper code used by array interface (req. GameAPI.cpp, obse\Utilities.cpp)
        Attempt to provide from Standard utilities for compatibility
    -   Version header
    -   Loader dll must export Query() & Load() symbols, and generally adhere to the plugin interface
    
    
-   COEF API Conventions:
=========================
A class definition in the API must, at minimum, correctly produce the following **for both the game and CS**:
    - Class name:  
        Extract from RTTI info in possible.  An educated guess should be made even for non-polymorphic types
    - Inheritance structure:
        Extract from RTTI.  Base classes must also be defined in the API.
    - Size:
        Start by finding the constructor, and trace back to find code that allocates the object.  
        Members should be laid out accordingly.  Their types & names do not need to be correct, but
        their offset within the object should be noted in a trailing comment: "// GameOffset/EditorOffset".
    - Virtual Function Table Size:
        All *new* and *overriden* virtual methods should be laid out in the correct order.  Their offset in the vtbl should be 
        clearly marked in a closed comment before the 'virtual' keyword: "/*GameOffset/EditorOffset*/ virtual  FuncName(...)"
        Dummy functions (e.g. void UnkX(void);) may be used if necessary.
        If a virtual method is not overriden from a parent class, it does not need to be included.
    - Methods:
        Only decoded methods should be included.  Wherever possible, methods should be given the correct signature 
        (name, calling convention, return & arg types, modifiers) and IMPORTed.  
        Exceptions are:
        -   Methods that are heavily inlined (no stand-alone instance can be found) - INLINE     
        Virtual methods that cannot be given proper signatures because they appear only as stubs should be INLINed with the appropriate stub.
        Virtual methods that cannot be given proper signatures because they have not yet been decoded should be inlined with a stub & marked NOUSE.
        NOUSE virtual methods have no effect so long as the game ctor & game vtbl are being used.  They will cause problems if the game ctor is
        *not* used, or if the compiler optimizes a virtual call into a direct call.
        Virtual methods with a common name but inherited from multiple base classes are a problem case.  Try to avoid naming collisions when
        giving names to methods of commonly inherited classes, e.g. for TESContainer use "AddContent()" rather than just "Add()".
        The exception is for methods that share a common purpose and will be overriden with thunks to a single central function, e.g.
        destructors or the common "GetModifiedSize()", etc.
    - New/Delete overloads:
        Classes must override thier new/delete operators with the FormHeap routines (the USEFORMHEAP macro).
        If the class has only a single base class that already does this, then it need not repeat.
        If a class has *multiple* base classes that do this, it will need to do it as well to avoid ambiguity.
    - Static Members:
        Only decoded static members with proper signature should be defined and IMPORTed.
