/*
    FormRefCounter

    The vanilla use info system is designed so that, when updating a form's reference info during CopyFrom(),
    all current references must be cleared before any new references are made (e.g. all calls to TESForm::RemoveCrossReference()
    come before any call to TESForm::AddCrossReference()).  The root of this limitation is that the use-info system
    does not track *how many times* one form references another, only that it does or does not.

    FormRefCounter is a supplementary class that can track reference changes more accurately.  Using it allows a CopyFrom() method 
    to be broken down into independent parts.

    FormRefCounter makes *no changes* to existing game or CS code; it is just a convenient accessory that makes the existing
    system easier to use.

    Useage:
    -   Call ClearRefences() to initialize the global data structure
    -   Call AddReference()/RemoveReference() instead of TESForm::AddCrossReference()/TESForm::RemoveCrossReference()
    -   After *all* reference count changes have been accounted for, call CommitReferences() to move 
        changes to the regular use info system.

    NOTE: to simplify code that uses it, the interface for this class is defined in both the game and CS.
           If called in game mode, the methods will have absolutely no effect.
